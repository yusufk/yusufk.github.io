title: My year at Microsoft
date: 2023-08-21

It's been over a year since I've paid any attention to this site, but for good reason. The last 13 month's have been crazy. After 16 years at MTN, I joined Microsoft's Africa Transformation Office, as a Tech-Lead for the start-ups and SME (small business) pillars.

## Swart vensterkies
Those that know me, were probably a little confused about my decision to join Microsoft, because I may have conveyed a conflicting view about the company throughout my career at MTN. I joined MTN after almost 10 years at the Meraka Institute at the CSIR. The institute was spear-heading Governments efforts to fast-track the adoption of open-source software in the public sector and I was fortunate to be a part of a team that lived open-source. We had contributors to the FreeBSD Kernel, projects like Digital Doorway running on Ubuntu, and Wireless Mesh networks built on a those and others.

At MTN, colleagues directed people looking for me saying, "hy's die een met die swart vensterkies" (he's the one with the black terminal windows). I managed to survive 16 years at MTN without using the official Windows image, accept on a VM for the occasional access to tooling that could not be accessed otherwise.

## YK-DOS
I was not trying to be anti-establishment but I had lost my admiration for Microsoft when I found open-source. The public views about open-source by Microsoft leadership at the time also made it easy to pick a side.

It wasn't always like that though. My 1st experience with a PC was also my 1st experience with Microsoft, on my dad's business 286, running MS-DOS 3.2. I search for and ran every .com, .exe, .bat file I could find, learnt to use the debugger, created awesome autoexec.bat sequences, and even edited command.com so that it displayed YK-DOS.

Windows 3.X was nothing short of miraculous, and I spent a fortune on a Genius Mouse to use it. I felt comfort knowing that MS-DOS was still within reach and did not enjoy Windows 98 because the PC booted straight into it and it felt too abstracted. Windows ME was strangely my best Windows experience (until Windows 11) and after that I switched to dual booting with Ubuntu Linux as primary while at Meraka.

Like many, Satya leadership, values and views on open-source opened my mind to giving Microsoft a chance. Everyone saw the change in narrative with his leadership, but I was curious as to how far he'd be able to go to change the company from within. That curiosity was a large part of why I decided to join Microsoft.

## No blue screens (yet)
My work at Microsoft kicked off on day 1 and accelerated from that point on and the year was over before I had time to take stock of all that happened. It was like riding a rollercoaster while drinking from a firehose! My questions about how far open-source had permeated the organisation were answered within the 1st month, as I found groups, projects, documentation and products relating to open-source initiatives. The sheer volume of things going on with just that label is overwhelming. WSL 2 was being tested and launched at the time, and I got to witness some of the internal conversations around Mariner / Azure Linux as it became accessible externally. I was worried about my experience on Windows, but WSL made it feel like I was back in control of things, pre-Windows 98, and I have to this day not had a blue-screen or bad app performance on my ThinkPad X1.

## Start-ups
There cannot be a faster learning path into Azure than working with start-ups. I engaged at least one new start-up every week, sometimes multiple. Many were one-off's and I got to build long-term relationships with others. There were very few common technical areas of interest and I found myself speed-learning everything from genomics to HCI depending on where the start-ups were going. Looking back, I could not have asked for a better opportunity to learn, although at the time, it often felt like I was on the back of a bronco bull, holding on for dear life.

## AI
And then there was AI. It's not often that one joins a company just ahead of a technology revolution and I was fortunate to be an insider at just the right time to witness AI take off. While most of the hype was centred around large enterprises that were just about coming to terms with Digital Transformation, many start-ups were also curious about whether they needed to pivot to take advantage of the wave to come. Many were well ahead of the curve and already extracting business value from AI.

My personal journey in AI took a leap forward as well. Having used AIML to create a chatbot for the noknok IM service in 2007, I've had a fascination with the potential for code to behave human-like. Nokita, like ChatGPT drew users' attention and fascination and accounted for more than 75% of active users traffic on noknok at one stage. What amazed me about LLM's was that one can achieve better results with 1 one-line prompt that I did with 6 months of training AIML.

Apologies, I've been busy
So this site has been neglected and I apologise (to myself?), but hopefully there's enough evidence out there on my GitHub activity and LinkedIn to account for my time. Right now, I'm focussing on Azure App Dev certification, so I may take the opportunity to practice using this site. This article was inspired by me checking in on the App Service settings as I read through the learning path. Hopefully, more updates to come!
