> If you can code and not make bugs your kin, If you can Git commit and push with ease, If you can work in Agile's fast-paced spin, And never miss a daily standup, please;
> 
> If you can write tests, both unit and integration, And not let code coverage make you drown, If you can refactor with no hesitation, And in pair programming, never wear a frown;
>
> If you can handle merge conflicts without strife, And navigate through nested JSON with glee, If you can find a balance in work-life, And still deploy code flawlessly;
> 
> If you can code in languages, more than a few, And understand that semicolons matter not, If you can debug with coffee as your brew, And JavaScript promises never forgot;
>
> If you can scale your app to millions of users, And keep your databases running smooth, If you can handle DevOps tasks, no excuses, And build a CI/CD pipeline in your groove;
>
>If you can learn new frameworks in a day, And contribute to open source just for fun, If you can master Python, JavaScript, and Rust, Yours is the world and everything that’s in it, And—which is more—you’ll be a Developer, my son!
