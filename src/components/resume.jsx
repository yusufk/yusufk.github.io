                                        <em>I joined the CSIR as part of their bursar program after school in 1997 and became part of the MERAKA Institutes "Wireless" team in 2003 after graduating. My constribution to the team was explore emerging wireless technologies and find innovative ways of using them to deliver services to the underserviced users in Africa.

                                            At the CSIR, I got to explore the use of VSAT, GPS, GSM, Bluetooth, Wifi Mesh and Mobile App development and built solutions that involved hardware and software development.
