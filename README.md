# My Learning Ground and Source Code for [https://yusuf.kaka.co.za](https://yusuf.kaka.co.za)

Personal websites have always been a good opportunity for me to learn new technologies and frameworks. My first encounter with HTML was in the late 90's with my site on Angelfire.com, which was then replaced by a blog on Blogger.com. I then moved to WordPress for a while, and at some point experimented with a slew of different frameworks.

This latest iteration was inspired by a need to get familiar with Node.js and newer JavaScript frameworks like React and Next.js. I also wanted to test the limits of static sites while experimenting with hosting options on Heroku, Digital Ocean, Azure, and AWS. In the end, I found it perfectly acceptable to host my site on GitHub Pages, with the source code on GitHub and the DNS managed by Cloudflare.
